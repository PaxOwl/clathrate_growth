GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, VERSION 5.1.2
Executable:   /Softs/lumiere/gromacs/gcc/5.1.2/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /Softs/lumiere/gromacs/gcc/5.1.2
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s topol.tpr -g md.log -o traj.trr -c conf.gro


Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.1#

Number of logical cores detected (16) does not match the number reported by OpenMP (1).
Consider setting the launch configuration manually!

Running on 2 nodes with total 32 cores, 32 logical cores
  Cores per node:           16
  Logical cores per node:   16
Hardware detected on host node2-22 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: GenuineIntel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: SSE4.1

Compiled SIMD instructions: SSE4.1, GROMACS could use AVX2_256 on this machine, which is better

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 5.1.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 20, rlist from 0.955 to 0.976

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1

Will use 24 particle-particle and 8 PME only ranks
This is a guess, check the performance at the end of the log file
Using 32 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity

Back Off! I just backed up traj.trr to ./#traj.trr.1#

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.2#
starting mdrun 'Methane in water'
20000000 steps,  20000.0 ps.

NOTE: Turning on dynamic load balancing


Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up conf.gro to ./#conf.gro.2#

 Average load imbalance: 4.5 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 3.2 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.465
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 11.1 %

NOTE: 11.1 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had less work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to decrease the number of PME ranks
      or decrease the cut-off and the grid spacing.

gcq#382: "I went to Venice and looked at the paintings of Canaletto to understand how he presented perspective, and it turned out it was an exponential law. If I had published this, maybe there would be a Karplus law in art theory as well as the Karplus equation in NMR" (Martin Karplus, Nobel lecture 2013)
