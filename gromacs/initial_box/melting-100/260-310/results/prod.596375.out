GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, VERSION 5.1.2
Executable:   /Softs/lumiere/gromacs/gcc/5.1.2/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /Softs/lumiere/gromacs/gcc/5.1.2
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s topol.tpr -g md.log -o traj.trr -c conf.gro


Number of logical cores detected (16) does not match the number reported by OpenMP (1).
Consider setting the launch configuration manually!

Running on 1 node with total 16 cores, 16 logical cores
Hardware detected on host node2-61 (the node of MPI rank 0):
  CPU info:
    Vendor: GenuineIntel
    Brand:  Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz
    SIMD instructions most likely to fit this hardware: AVX2_256
    SIMD instructions selected at GROMACS compile time: SSE4.1

Compiled SIMD instructions: SSE4.1, GROMACS could use AVX2_256 on this machine, which is better

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 5.1.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 25, rlist from 0.953 to 0.982

The number of OpenMP threads was set by environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1
Using 16 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.1#

20000 steps,     20.0 ps.

NOTE: Turning on dynamic load balancing


Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up conf.gro to ./#conf.gro.1#

 Average load imbalance: 3.4 %
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.3 %
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %
