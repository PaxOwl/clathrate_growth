GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2019.1
Executable:   /Softs/lumiere/gromacs/mpi/gcc/2019.1-sp/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /Softs/lumiere/gromacs/mpi/gcc/2019.1-sp
Working dir:  /Work/Users/ctsilefski/simulations/initial_box/equilibration
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s topol.tpr -g md.log -o traj.trr -c conf.gro


Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.2#
Compiled SIMD: AVX_256, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2019.1 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 0.951 to 1.021

Using 16 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity

Back Off! I just backed up traj.trr to ./#traj.trr.2#

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.2#
starting mdrun 'Methane in water'
120000 steps,    120.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up conf.gro to ./#conf.gro.2#


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 2.3%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 73%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.7%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %
