NOTE 1 [file grompp_equilibration.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 2 [file grompp_equilibration.mdp]:
  The Berendsen thermostat does not generate the correct kinetic energy
  distribution. You might want to consider using the V-rescale thermostat.

Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Analysing residue names:
There are:    64      Water residues
Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.001 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.716 nm, buffer size 0.016 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.701 nm, buffer size 0.001 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 14x14x14, spacing 0.143 0.143 0.143
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 381.00
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.58

NOTE 3 [file grompp_equilibration.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.

Setting gen_seed to 1803310499
Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 298 K
Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 381.00
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.58

NOTE 3 [file grompp_equilibration.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
