Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'WAT'
Setting gen_seed to -1993966135
Velocities were taken from a Maxwell distribution at 298 K
Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 381.00
Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.58

NOTE 3 [file grompp_equilibration.mdp]:
  The optimal PME mesh load for parallel simulations is below 0.5
  and for highly parallel simulations between 0.25 and 0.33,
  for higher performance, increase the cut-off and the PME grid spacing.
